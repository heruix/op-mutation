# op-mutation
experiments in mixed-boolean arithmetic obfuscation 

# what is mixed-boolean arithmetic?
a term some people smarter than me coined for arithmetic expressions that contain both traditional boolean algebra (and, or, not) and arithmetic (add, sub, mul) operators

# why is this interesting?
it's not really, i just found a quarkslab paper on it and thought "hey i can do that." -- by the way, the people at quarkslab are very smart, you should look them up if you dont know about them

# haven't things like this been solved already?
yes

# so then why is this useful?
it's not
